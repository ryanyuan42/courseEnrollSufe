# courseEnrollSufe
Hi, this project is mainly aiming at helping SUFE students get enrolled.

This is a unfinished project with a lot of places to modify.
If you are interested, you may clone the project and test it and modify it.

Currently, it will send msg to your email address if anything happened. I don't think it helps any though...

Usage:

```python course_enrollment.py```

This project act as a web crawler to keep sending enroll request to the server if it discvoer there is an extra spot.(The part I didn't write yet)


There are two problems in this project,
 * It has to be opened all the time by your computer. (I am thinking about using cloud platform? make it a web app?)
 * It can not get the neccessary information to enroll in a class automatically. Still it requies human work.(for the course id and v)
